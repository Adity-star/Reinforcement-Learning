# Reinforcement Learning: Training a Dog to Fetch a Stick

This repository contains the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model using Hugging Face's Huggy environment to train a virtual dog to fetch a stick. The [Notebook](https://github.com/Adity-star/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Intro%20to%20RL/Reinforcement%20Learning%20with%20Huggy/Reniforcement_Learning_with_Huggy.ipynb) demonstrates how RL can be applied to a simple task in a simulated environment.

## Overview

In this project, we use reinforcement learning to train an agent (a virtual dog) to perform a basic task: fetching a stick. The goal is to teach the dog to navigate towards the stick and bring it back to its starting position.

The training environment is built using a custom simulation, and Hugging Face's RL libraries are utilized for implementing the agent and learning process.
